========================

https://github.com/peej/the-to.uri.st-spider

The to.uri.st Web spider is an HTTP spider to pull tourist attraction data from
the public Web into the to.uri.st attraction database.

== About

This tool can be used to pull data from public Web sites into a format that can
be loaded into the to.uri.st open tourist attraction database - http://to.uri.st/

== Requirements

PHP 5.1+ CLI with the CURL extension

== Usage

The core library spider.php is not designed to be executed directly, instead it
should be envoked from another PHP script that uses the library to extract and
process the data.

The file example.php gives an example of this usage.

The library spider.php contains doc comments outlining the libraries objects and
public interfaces.
